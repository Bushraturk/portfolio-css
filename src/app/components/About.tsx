        I am a passionate frontend developer with a strong foundation in HTML,
        CSS, and TypeScript. <br /> I love creating responsive, user-friendly web
        designs and am currently expanding my skills to become a full stack
        developer. <br /> With a keen interest in modern web development technologies
        like Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I enjoy turning creative ideas into
        functional, efficient websites.
